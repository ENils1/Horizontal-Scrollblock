G502 Horizontal Mouse Wheel Disable Mod for Minecraft Fabric
Overview:

This Minecraft Fabric mod addresses an issue with the Logitech G502 mouse, specifically with its horizontal mouse wheel sensitivity. When using the "pick block" function in Minecraft, the physical button on the G502 can be overly sensitive, leading to unintended triggers of the horizontal mouse wheel button.

To enhance your gameplay experience, this mod is designed to disable the horizontal mouse wheel functionality on the Logitech G502 when using the "pick block" feature in Minecraft.
